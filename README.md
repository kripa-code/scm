Hello!
I'm Kripa Shankar Yadav. A student at Amity University Bengaluru.

👋 About Me

Hey there! I’m a curious and creative learner currently exploring the world of software development, AI, and web technologies. I enjoy building things that solve real problems and make life a little easier—or more interesting.

💻 What I Am

I’m a college student with a strong interest in technology, passionate about learning new tools and frameworks. I experiment with Python, web development (HTML, CSS, Django), and recently started diving into AI-powered projects using tools like FastAPI and LLaMA.

🛠️ What I Do
	•	Build web apps (currently working on Shots, an Instagram-like platform)
	•	Tinker with backend systems and APIs
	•	Participate in hackathons and tech events
	•	Practice problem-solving with Python
	•	Explore side projects like AI WhatsApp repliers, automation scripts, and more

🌱 What I Wish To Do
	•	Become a full-stack developer with strong backend and AI integration skills
	•	Contribute to open-source projects
	•	Launch a real-world product/startup
	•	Deepen my knowledge of system design, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure
	•	Learn and grow every day in tech and beyond

📂 About This Repository
This repository is my Source Code Management Lab, where I’m learning the basics of Git and GitHub by making small changes to beginner-friendly code. It’s a practice space where I:
	•	Create, clone, and manage repositories
	•	Make commits and branches
	•	Merge changes and resolve conflicts
	•	Experiment with version control in a safe environment
